# Money-Flow
##### Program for tracking income / expenses and budget planning


Keeping track of your expenses and income is one of the most important parts of being organized and successful. Even if you earn large sums, you always need to control your money, otherwise they will control you.

There are several solutions, such as keeping a journal, but the journal may not always be at hand, or you may forget to record your transactions.

Therefore, it is very important to have a small helper always at hand, and ***Money-Flow*** is exactly that. The monitored monitoring of your card transactions, general budget management, statistics and calculation of money for a month / day / week are exactly the things that can simplify my life at times.
